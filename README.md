# blinkit-sales-analysis-excel-dashboard
This project features an interactive Excel dashboard analyzing Blinkit sales performance. After gathering, cleaning, and organizing the data, I used pivot tables, charts, and slicers to highlight total sales, top categories, outlet trends, and customer ratings—all in one view. It's a very practical Excel-driven project that shows everything.
